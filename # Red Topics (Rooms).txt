## **What is Networking**

A network is a name given to all the devices connected together.

The Internet is a vast network made up of many smaller networks.

An IP Address consists of 4 octets.

IPv6 is more efficient and can **support more IP addresses** than IPv4.

A MAC address is like a serial number of a device; it **cannot be changed** even after a change in location, whereas IP addresses can.

**Note:** MAC Addresses *can* be spoofed!

## **Intro to LAN**

- **Ping** uses **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to check connection quality (existence and stability).
- The time ICMP packets take is measured by ping.

- **Star topology**: devices inserted into a central hub.
- **Ring topology**: devices connected in a ring-like structure.

- Routers connect different networks and route traffic based on IP addresses.
- Switches connect devices within the same network through packet switching.

- Subnetting divides a network into smaller parts for better performance.

- To identify addresses, you need a Host Address.

- A Cache stores other devices' names on the network.

- An ARP request is sent to all devices to find a matching IP address.

- An ARP response acknowledges the request.

- ARP = Address Resolution Protocol.

- DHCP assigns and manages IP addresses.

## **The OSI Model**

The OSI model is employed to transmit data based on layers.

**Encapsulation**: adding pieces of information to data.

### Layers:

7. **Application** — end user services (web browsing, email, file transfers).
Examples:
- Browser (Chrome) uses Application to get google.com
- Outlook uses SMTP (Layer 7) to send email.

6. **Presentation** — converts data size to be compatible, helps encrypt emails (partially), compresses data size, acts as translator.
Examples:
- Server sends JSON but app needs XML → reformats data.
- Negotiates encryption (AES, RSA) but doesn't actually encrypt.
- gzip compression on web traffic.

5. **Session** — establishes, manages, and terminates connections, divides data into chunks to allow re-sending if lost.

4. **Transport** — splits data into packets, adds port numbers (like apartment numbers), chooses TCP or UDP.

- **TCP (Reliable):**
  - ✅ Guarantees delivery (resends lost packets)
  - ✅ Preserves order of data
  - ❌ Slower (used for websites, emails)

- **UDP (Fast):**
  - ✅ Very fast (no acknowledgments)
- ❌ No retransmit if data lost (live streaming, online games)

- **Time to Live (TLL)** times out packets so network won't be clogged.

## Network Layers Summary:

| Layer | Function                  | Key Info                                      |
|-------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 3     | Network                  | IP addresses, routers, Internet/WAN          |
| 2     | Data Link                | MAC addresses, frames, switches, LAN          |
| 1     | Physical                 | Raw bits over cables/waves, no logic           |

## **Packets and Frames**

- Packets = small data pieces transmitted **across networks (WAN/Internet)** with the help of **IP addresses**.

- Frames = data units transmitted **within local networks (LAN)** with the help of **MAC addresses**.

### How They Work Together:

1. PC sends HTTP request → packaged into a **packet** (Layer 3).
2. Packet wrapped in a **frame** (Layer 2) for local delivery.
3. Switch reads **MAC address** in frame, forwards it.
4. Router strips frame, reads **IP address** in packet, routes to Internet.

---
**Packets** = IPs + Routers (Internet)
**Frames** = MACs + Switches (LAN)

**Frames carry packets just like trucks carry envelopes!**
